# deal-or-no-deal
A simulation of the game show "Deal or No Deal" in Python. User inputs are prompted for actions like selecting an initial case, opening other cases, and deciding whether to take the dealer's offer or continue playing. The output shows cases remaining, along with the available prizes remaining as the game progresses.
